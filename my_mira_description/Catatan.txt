1. Create package
    catkin_create_pkg my_mira_description rospy rviz controller_manager gazebo_ros joint_state_publisher robot_state_publisher
    
2. Create the following folders inside it:
    - launch
    - models
    - rviz_config
    - config
    - urdf
    - worlds

3. Go to touch folder and create mira_simple.urdf

4. The main elements to define in a joint are:
    Type:   there are these types: revolute, continuous, prismatic, fixed, floating, and planar.
            You can learn more here: http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML/joint The joint selection will 
            depend on how the physical model of your robot moves.
    Parent and Child: Here is where you set who is connected to your link.
    Origin: All of the coordinates and rpy are referenced to the Parent axis, not the child axis.
    Limit:  This is a very important element, especially when you have to control a robot movement.
    Axis:   Here you define around which Parent's AXIS the Child link will revolve.
            This, of course, depends on the type of joint; some of them don't have axis tags
            because they are irrelevant, such as the fixed joint.

5. roslaunch my_mira_description urdf_visualize.launch model:='$(find my_mira_description)/urdf/mira_simple.urdf'

6. You will have to add two elements in RVIZ:
    RobotModel: In this case, just select the robot_description variable for the RobotDescription field.
    TF        : Will turn green as soon as you select the correct fixed frame, in this case base_link.

7. As you can see, you have RVIZ, but also a window with a slider. This slider allows you to move the joints.
    It's the JointStatePublisher Gui. This is vital for checking if the joints are correctly set in the URDF.
    It also allows you to see if the given limits in the joints are the correct ones.
    If you can't see the "joint control" window, it must be behind the RVIZ window. Just move it around and,
    to avoid any further loss, right click on it and select in Layers-->Always On Top

8. You can also see the Link-Joint structure of any URDF file through the urdf_to_graphiz tool. Just execute the following:
    - roscd my_mira_description/urdf
    - urdf_to_graphiz mira_simple.urdf
        This tool generates the link and joint tree:
        Created file mira_simple.gv
        Created file mira_simple.pdf
